dead...wait

merging with the ground
amplified is the sound
im moving so slow
im starting to come down...

these waves of ignorance
feels like an endless dance
i hear the music playing but
im stuck in this toxic trance...

i never ment to feel this way
im dead... wait please stay
im dead...wait

forgetting everything ive known
but i dont want to go home
dont you fucking touch me
i think its better if you go...

i feel dead but no one cares
wait! no ones even there
ill give in to suicde
my bloods every where...

i never ment to feel this way
im dead... wait please stay
im dead...wait

i feel you see me
you think im alive
but im dead...wait

im dead...
