buried

wanting something i could never have
conforming just to get me by
i cant waste my time being sad
counting the days untill i die...

living with people that i hate
every day i feel disgraced
why cant you take this all away
death is my only escape...

(chorus)
BURIED UNDERNEATH
all my problems
BURIED UNDERNEATH
all my scars
lies a beating heart
with no reason
keeping me alive
for too long...

i have lost something 
so preacious deep inside
no matter how long i search 
i know ill never find
the missing pieces of my life 
are lost amongst the stars
this life is like a fucking cage
im trapped behind the bars...

all my friends
have fallin away from me
if i dont find my self 
ill never be set free
i have to distance myself 
from you
through my loneliness
i know ill find the truth...

(chorus)
BURIED UNDERNEATH
all my problems
BURIED UNDERNEATH
all my scars
lies a beating heart
with no reason
keeping me alive
for too long...

how can i follow you if you are lost as well
this life is torture and it feels like im in hell
you lied to me and said that all i need is love
with out the missing pieces ill never rise above...
