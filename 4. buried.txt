buried

A craving fierce, yet to me, never fed
my heart i pierce, sick of me, in the end
my death i rehearse, bleed in me, 
what i said
in this universe, lost in me, seeing red...

(chorus)
BURIED UNDERNEATH
all my problems
BURIED UNDERNEATH
all my scars
lies a beating heart
with no reason
keeping me alive
for too long...

i have lost something 
so preacious deep inside
no matter how long i search 
i know ill never find
the missing pieces of my life 
are lost amongst the stars
this life is like a fucking cage
im trapped behind the bars...

all my friends
have fallin away from me
if i dont find my self 
ill never be set free
i have to distance myself 
from you
through my loneliness
i know ill find the truth...

(chorus)
BURIED UNDERNEATH
all my problems
BURIED UNDERNEATH
all my scars
lies a beating heart
with no reason
keeping me alive
for too long...

how can i follow you if you are lost as well
this life is torture and it feels like im in hell
you lied to me and said that all i need is love
with out the missing pieces ill never rise above...
