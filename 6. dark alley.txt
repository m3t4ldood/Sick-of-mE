Dark Alleys (this is a lie)

all the dark alleys in my mind
lead me down to where ill find
the reason why i was chosen
to be alive...
I need to value my heart
More than the possibility of being hurt
So I kept it locked away from you
I've been occupied by all of my ****ed-up thoughts
For so long
i used to think id never belong
i kept singing the same old song
of tourment through my life
untill i realized...

THIS IS A LIE!!!
THIS IS A LIE!!!
I AM LOST INSIDE
MY OWN LIFE...
THIS IS A LIE!!!
I DONT KNOW WHY
I HATE MYSELF AS
MUCH AS I HATE YOU...

i used to think my heart was worth
more to me than getting hurt
so i locked it away from you...
all the dark alleys in my mind
there closing in all of the time
ive been consumed by all my
****ed up lies...

THIS IS A LIE!!!
THIS IS A LIE!!!
I AM LOST INSIDE
MY OWN LIFE...
THIS IS A LIE!!!
I DONT KNOW WHY
I HATE MYSELF AS
MUCH AS I HATE YOU...

i tried to impress you but
i dont know why because of
all this i feel like i want
to die...

all the dark alleys in my mind
i have to walk them the resst of my life
untill i leave my body my soul
will never fly...

i used to be someone
i thought i had control
i am just a **** up
rotting in this dark ally...
