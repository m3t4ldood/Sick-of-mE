Dreaming even after death 



I awaken covered in blood 

am i dying 

I try to think but it hurts my head 

I'll stop trying 

There's shattered glass every where 

I can't stop bleeding 

I lay here finally sober

Or am I just dreaming... 



Im not dreaming of you

I can't think anymore 

I'm not screaming at you

I can't feel anymore

Just a corpse on the floor 

Can't take this anymore 

I know now that im just

Dreaming even after death... 

im still dreaming even after death
i cant get these images out of my head
insomnias my only friend to help me realize...
