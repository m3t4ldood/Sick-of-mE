candle light  

in the darkness of my mind  
im waiting to see you  
all though patience is a virtue  
this silence is tourture...   

(chorus)  
i confide inside of my mind 
your the life of my candle light  
guide me through this darkness 
inside of my mind with the candle light...   

lie to me and tell me  
that my life means something  
it wont matter if i die  
all you gain is nothing...
NOTHING INSIDE!!!   

cant you see me  
i am bleeding  
cant you hear me  
screaming inside of my mind 
with my candle light...   

(chorus)  
i confide inside of my mind 
your the life of my candle light  
guide me through this darkness 
inside of my mind with the candle light...
