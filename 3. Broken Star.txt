With ink in hand, to this paper I bleed 
all of these words left unspoken 
when put me down im feeling incomplete 
all of my dreams are broken  

all I’ve ever wanted to be 
is something more than me
im just a child to you 
feeling dumb and weak  

did you build me up just to tear me down 
while you laugh at me like a fucking clown 
I never thought I’d make it this far 
with all my dreams on a broken star  

I take you down with my words 
the more you cry the more it hurts 
blood shot eyes believe in my lies 
i just wanted to be something 
 
so much bigger than you so much better than me 
now all you see is a broken star  
i wasted my life gave in to this lie 
im still a nobody just a broken star  

its all in my head this delusional life 
going to end some day and you know i tried  
the anger pride and shame 
i know im not the only one to blame 
chasng a ghost of a false reality 
might as well cut my eyes out 
cus its something i will never see
