
(Verse 1)
Staring into this void, an empty page in sight,
No thoughts to guide me throught this, lost in endless night,
My words, fadeing to obscurity, no meaning to defy,
An empty vessel stripped of purity, lost in the abyss of my mind.

Searching for something new, 
a taste of agony,
Craving the pain, the fire that sets me free,
Within your depths, I delve, seeking solace in your stare,
But it's all so familiar, the pain that we both bear.

(Pre-Chorus)
What's poison to you, a toxin in your veins,
A toxic elixir, a darkness that remains,
But I thrive in the chaos, embrace the despair,
The thrill of destruction, I'm beyond repair.

(Chorus)
What's bad for you, it's my twisted ecstasy,
The pain is my symphony, my twisted melody,
It's consuming me, yet I stand unswayed,
Embracing the torment, the price must be paid.

(Verse 2)
Shattered dreams, fragments of my past,
Drowning in regrets, this descent too fast,
The faces I despise, reveal my path ahead,
I've lost the treasures, now I'm bound by dread.

Yearning for something new, to taste the agony's kiss,
Seeking the storm, the chaos that I miss,
And when I peer within your depths so wide,
It's just a reflection of the pain inside.

(Pre-Chorus)
What's poison to you, a venomous reality,
A world of illusions, a painful duality,
But I thrive in the chaos, my soul unchained,
In the depths of my darkness, forever I remain.

(Chorus)
What's bad for you, it's my only remedy,
Embracing the shadows, a dance with misery,
It's devouring me, but I won't back down,
Embracing the darkness, the thorny crown.

(Bridge)
It's killing me, this sweet agony,
A dance of fire and ice, a symphony,
I've surrendered to the depths of despair,
In the wreckage of my soul, I find my air.

(Chorus)
What's bad for you, it's the cure I crave,
Walking the edge, in shadows I engrave,
It's all that I've known, all that I bear,
In the embrace of chaos, I find my solace rare.

(Outro)
I don't care about the pain that tears me apart,
For in this broken symphony, I find my art,
Embracing the darkness, a twisted kind of thrill,
In the heart of destruction, I stand still.
