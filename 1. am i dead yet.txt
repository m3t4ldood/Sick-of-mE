am i dead yet?

the sickness inside me
my bodys trying to fight me
my demise is unlikely
cus i know i wont hold on...

i am feeling faint
my blood is the paint
on the walls in my mind
and their running dry...

#my suicide is like insanity 
(am i dead yet?)
every time i cave 
it takes apart of me
(am i dead yet?)
i try to numb the pain
every day
(am i dead yet?)
but all i can do is fall down yelling
make this go away...

i cant let the blood hit the floor
if i do i will be no more
i feel like such a whore
cus i give into this lie...

i take it all in stride
as i swallow my pride
wishing that i had died
cus my life is so untrue...

#my whole life is nothing
but insanity
(are you dead yet?)
whys it so hard dealing 
with inhumanity
(are you dead yet?)
i cant help these thoughts in my head
a nessecity
(are you dead yet?)
if i dont fix myself
and get out of this hell 
it will be the end of me...
its a means to get by...

been laying here for days
my lonelyness is not a phase
with all these things i regret
am i dead yet?...

Verse 1:
I'm sick of feeling like a burden
I'm sick of feeling all alone
I'm sick of living in this darkness
I'm sick of feeling like I'm not shown

Chorus:
Suicide, it's my escape
Suicide, I won't be late
Suicide, I'll end the pain
Suicide, I'll finally be sane

Verse 2:
They say it's a permanent solution
To a temporary problem, that's a lie
I'll just be moving on to the next life
Where I can finally fly

Chorus:
Suicide, it's my escape
Suicide, I won't be late
Suicide, I'll end the pain
Suicide, I'll finally be sane

Bridge:
But wait, what if there's more to life
What if I'm just caught in a strife
What if I'm meant to do something great
Something that will seal my fate

Outro:
I can't let go, I won't let go
I'll find a way to rise above
I won't give in, I'll never give in
I'll find a way to love

This song takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to the topic of suicide, using irony to challenge the notion that suicide is a viable solution to problems. It encourages the listener to consider alternative options and to seek help if they are struggling.
